## 9) Recommendations  
   ### Payment Experience
-  Central (Online) â†’ Strengthen online payment channels, ensure fast and secure checkout, and offer online-exclusive discounts.
-  North, South, East (Cash) â†’ optimize cash-handling logistics, but also run awareness campaigns or small incentives to nudge customers toward digital payments for efficiency.
-  West (Debit Card) â†’ Partner with banks to give cardholders benefits (e.g., cashback or loyalty points). Ensure debit card systems are reliable and seamless.
   ### Regional Sales & Product Demand
- Tablets are the highest-demand product overall (2,519 units). Ensure strong inventory and promotional focus across all regions.
  ### Region-specific product strategies:
- North: Desk (high demand) â†’ Ensure stock availability for desks in North to avoid revenue loss due to stockouts .
- South: Desk (lowest demand) â†’ Review pricing or reposition desks in South to reduce low-performing SKUs
- West: Tablet (top seller) â†’ maintain promotions; potential to bundle with accessories.
   ### Promotion Effectiveness
- Promotions significantly boost sales volume (e.g., North: 2,472 with vs 900 without). Scale successful promotions, but monitor margin impact. Test data-driven promotional campaigns to balance revenue and profitability.
- Run A/B testing of promotion types( e.g discount vs bundle) to identify the most profitable strategy
   ### Discount Strategy
- North has the highest average discount (7.6%). Perform a margin impact analysis to determine whether discounts drive sustainable revenue growth or reduce profitability.. Consider **tiered discounts** tied to customer loyalty rather than blanket reductions.
  ### Returns Management
- Since total returns are relatively low (372 units), continue monitoring but create a returns dashboard to detect unusual spikes early.
